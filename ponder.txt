Your Name: Israel Garcia

1. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

The most interesting thing I learned about this week was connecting to another computer using SSH. I would like to learn more about the things I can do with SSH.


2. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

I reached out for help because I didn't know how to sign out of the linux lab computer, but I got a quick response. I also went through slack and answered some questions people had about signing in to linux lab and python.

3. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?

I know it's not really necessary for the class, but I think I would want to learn more about SSH and what more I can do with it. I think this will be a useful skill to have on my resume when I start looking for jobs.


4. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2 Hours
Checkpoint A - 10 Mins
Checkpoint B - 10 Mins
Prove Assignment - 30 Mins
